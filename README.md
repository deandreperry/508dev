## Overview

508 Dev is an interactive accessibility engineering platform designed for developers who build production user interfaces.

Instead of teaching accessibility through static documentation alone, 508 Dev provides live playgrounds, production-ready component patterns, keyboard interaction systems, screen reader-focused behaviors, WCAG references, developer utilities, and interactive testing environments.

The platform is intentionally built as a single-file application with zero build tooling and zero runtime dependencies beyond the browser.

It is optimized primarily for:

* desktop
* laptop
* modern browsers

Mobile and tablet experiences remain responsive and functional, but the core experience is designed around developer workflows on larger screens.

---

## Why 508 Dev Exists

Most accessibility education falls into one of two categories:

1. Compliance-heavy documentation
2. Surface-level design guidance

Neither teaches developers how accessibility actually behaves in production.

508 Dev was created to bridge that gap.

The goal is to help developers:

* understand real accessibility failures
* test keyboard interactions
* visualize semantic structure
* learn ARIA behavior
* understand WCAG implementation
* ship accessible UI systems confidently

Every feature is implementation-focused.

---

## Features

# Interactive Accessibility Playgrounds

Hands-on WCAG playgrounds designed to demonstrate accessibility failures and production-ready solutions side-by-side.

### Included playgrounds

* Target Size (WCAG 2.5.8)
* Redundant Entry (WCAG 3.3.7)
* Non-text Contrast (WCAG 1.4.11)
* Identify Input Purpose (WCAG 1.3.5)

Each playground demonstrates:

* failing implementations
* accessible implementations
* keyboard interaction differences
* visual contrast behavior
* real-world UX impact

---

# Pattern Library

Production-style accessibility patterns with:

* semantic structure
* ARIA usage
* keyboard interaction maps
* copyable implementation code
* accessibility explanations
* live interaction testing

### Included patterns

* Modal Dialog
* Tabs
* Combobox
* Toast Notifications
* Tooltips
* Skip Links
* Accordions
* Menus
* Form Validation
* Date Input Systems

The pattern system focuses on implementation realism rather than simplified demo components.

---

# WCAG Reference System

Full WCAG 2.2 reference layer including:

* all 87 success criteria
* level filtering (A / AA / AAA)

The reference layer behaves more like developer documentation than compliance documentation.

---

---

## Philosophy

508 Dev is built around one core belief:

Accessibility should be learned through interaction, implementation, and testing — not passive reading.

Developers understand systems by:

* building
* testing
* breaking
* navigating
* inspecting
* comparing

The platform is intentionally designed to feel like modern developer tooling rather than educational software.

The goal is to make accessibility engineering feel practical, production-focused, and deeply integrated into front-end development workflows.
